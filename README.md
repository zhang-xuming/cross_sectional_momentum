# cross_sectional_momentum
## result analysis
I randomly selected 50 stocks from Shanghai Stock Exchange from April 2017 to April 2021 and simulate cross_sectional_momentum strategy from `Do momentum and reversals coexist.pdf`.From the results, these stocks' momentum effects are not strong. Although loser does have disadvantages, winner has no obvious return advantages. Interestingly, P2 (secondary loser) has achieved good returns in each test. Can it prove that in the China stock market with retail investors accounting for more than 30%, the reversal strategy is more suitable than the momentum strategy?
## further research
* Use more and more flexible combination tests, such as SSE 50, CSI 300, GEM index, SSE STAR 50 and etc
* Use data with a longer time span
* Use more mathematical methods to analyze data
